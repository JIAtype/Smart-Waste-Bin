# 🗑️ Smart Waste Bin Proposal

## 🚀 Project Overview

In the era of smart buildings and digital campuses, **traditional waste management solutions** no longer meet the efficiency, sustainability, and real-time requirements of modern facilities. Manual checking and collection of waste bins are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often lead to overflowing bins or incorrect sorting.

**Smart Waste Bin** leverages the power of robotics, artificial intelligence, and IoT to deliver a revolutionary, autonomous waste collection and classification solution—enabling next-generation smart recycling for large workspaces, campuses, and public venues.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Autonomous Navigation & Path Planning**
   
   - Design a robotic waste bin capable of *self-navigation*, real-time obstacle avoidance, and optimal route planning using SLAM, A* and Dijkstra algorithms.
2. **Real-time Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance**
   
   - Deploy **multi-sensor fusion** and Raspberry Pi controllers to continuously track bin fill level, location, and movement.
   - Visualize data via a dynamic dashboard and predict emptying needs for optimized scheduling.
3. **AI-powered Garbage Classification**
   
   - Develop **machine vision models** (CNNs, SVM, PCA) to classify waste (plastic, paper, metal, etc.) in real-time, maximizing sorting accuracy and recycling efficiency.
